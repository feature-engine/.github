# Welcome to Feature-engine

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feature-engine/.github/main/call_for_sponsors.png" width="1500">]([https://www.trainindata.com](https://github.com/sponsors/solegalli))

My name is Sole, the leading instructor at [**Train in Data**](https://www.trainindata.com/) and the maintainer of [**Feature-engine**](https://github.com/feature-engine/feature_engine), 
and together with a group of passionate data scientists and software developers, we maintain and expand the functionality of this Python library for feature engineering 
and feature selection for machine learning and its documentation, so you can better prepare your data to craft more powerful and interpretable 
machine learning models.

At [**Train in Data**](https://www.trainindata.com/), we create intermediate and advanced online courses on machine learning, data science and AI software development, to help you boost
your data science skills and leverage the power of this and other popular Python libraries, to create faster and robust machine learning pipelines. 

We talk, blog and participate in podcasts about machine learning, software development and open-source, so you'll hear about us a lot on the digital
sphere ;)
